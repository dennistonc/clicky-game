# Animal Crossing Clicky Game

### Week 19 Homework
#### About This Homework

This is a memory game made with React. The application's UI is broken into components, manages component state, and responds to user events. The app utilizes react, html, css, bootstrap, and javascript. 
<br />

#### How it Works
The user clicks on a random animal crossing character image to start the game and tries not to click on the same image twice. The images reshuffle after each click and points are tallied if they have a streak of correct guesses. The score resets to 0 if the user hits a wrong character.
